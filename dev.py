"""Static file server for local development.

The hub is a static site now — there is no backend to run, and no per-module
`python3 server.py` on its own port. This exists only so the pages are served
over http:// rather than file://, which Google sign-in and ES modules both
require.

Port 5173 is the default deliberately: it is Vite's, which means it is almost
certainly already listed under "Authorized JavaScript origins" on the OAuth
client this project shares with the System Design hub. Serving from an
unregistered origin makes Google reject the sign-in popup with origin_mismatch.

Run:  python3 dev.py          then open http://localhost:5173/
      python3 dev.py 5174     (must also be a registered origin)

 * the DOM and swaps those for blob: URLs, which browsers treat as ordinary
 * same-origin content.
 *
 * HTML documents get one extra step. They were authored alongside an assets/
 * folder and still reference it relatively ("assets/hi/x.svg"), but a blob:
 * URL has no directory to resolve against, so every one of those links would
 * break. Before building the blob we rewrite each relative asset reference to
 * the blob: URL of that asset in Drive, using the assets-map.json produced

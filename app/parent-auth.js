/* Accept a Google session handed down by a host page that frames this app.
 *
 * PG Hub Tech (pradhapganesanjava.github.io/pghubtech/) embeds this site in an
 * iframe. Both are the same origin in production, so the frame already shares
 * that tab's sessionStorage — but the two apps namespace their keys
 * differently ('pghubtechs_tok' here, 'pghtech_tok' there), so sharing the storage
 * area is not enough on its own. The host posts its token; this module writes
 * it under OUR key in OUR shape, and the gate's existing restore() path takes
 * it from there. No second sign-in, no second consent screen.
 *
 * Standalone (not framed) this module does nothing at all.

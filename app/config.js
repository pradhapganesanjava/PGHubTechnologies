/* PG Hub Technologies — runtime configuration.
 *
 * This file ships in a PUBLIC repository. It deliberately contains no Drive
 * folder ids, no file ids, and no email addresses: everything identifying is
 * either resolved at runtime (folder lookup by name, after sign-in) or stored
 * as a one-way hash. The OAuth client id below is public by design — Google
 * treats it as an identifier, not a secret, and it is useless without a user
 * consenting in a browser.
 *
 * WHERE SECURITY ACTUALLY COMES FROM
 * ----------------------------------
 * Not from this file. The content lives in a private Google Drive folder owned
 * by one account; Drive's own ACL is what keeps it private. allowedEmailHashes
 * below is a courtesy check so a stray visitor gets a clear "this isn't your
 * hub" message instead of a wall of Drive 404s — it is NOT a security boundary,
 * because anyone can edit client-side JavaScript. Do not add anything here that
 * would be harmful to read.

  /* Scopes.
   *
   * `drive.file` grants access per-file to files the *application* created,
   * where the application is the Google Cloud project — and the migration tool
   * (Desktop client) shares project pg-hub-tech with this Web client, so the
   * content it uploaded is reachable here for both read and write.
   *
   * `drive.readonly` is kept as a safety net: if per-project file access ever
   * does not apply, reads still work and the app degrades to read-only rather
   * than showing an empty hub. If you see 403s on SAVE (not on load), swap the
   * two entries below for the single scope
   * 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive' and re-consent once.
